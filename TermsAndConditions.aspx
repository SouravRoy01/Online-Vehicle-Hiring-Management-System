                    to everyone that is willing to take out a few minutes from their busy schedule 
                    to sign up with us. We don&#39;t have an elaborate section on terms and conditions, 
                    as we believe that our customers already have the minimum ethics needed to keep 
                    our cars neat and clean. Besides this, we ask only for patience from you. For 
                    customers who like to break the rules and challenge us, here are a few basic 
                    guidelines for you:<br />
                    <br />
&nbsp;<span class="style11">= &gt;</span> We always try our best to be at your doorstep by the time 
                    confirmed by you, but if, in case, we are late by a matter of minutes, you need 
                    to be patient. We drive cars, not aeroplanes!<br />
                    <br />
&nbsp;<span class="style11">= &gt; </span>Customers who hire cars for a duration more than that 
                    confirmed, are liable to pay extra charges, which might be at par with regular 
                    rates.<br />
                    <br />
&nbsp;<span class="style11">= &gt; </span>Misbehaving with our drivers for no valid reason can cause 
                    you severe trouble as our drivers are our employees and we value our employees 
                    as much as we value our customers.<br />
                    <br />
&nbsp;<span class="style11">= &gt; </span>Causing damage to any accessory interior or exterior to the 
                    car hired will directly be reflected in your bill.
                    <br />
                    <br />
                    <span class="style11">= &gt; </span>The maximum number of people allowed in the car 
                    is specified while booking a car. Only two children (of 8 years of age or below) 
                    will be allowed extra. No other individual will be allowed, whatsoever.<br />
                    <br />
                    <span class="style11">= &gt; </span>The company owns the right to cancel the 
                    bookings of any customer, without giving reasons for it. No complaint can be 
                    lodged in this context.
